<h4 id="when">Is there an estimated date when this will be done?</h4>
<p>No, we do not have one. We don't give dates because that makes work under pressure (or sometimes the plan does not go as it should) so we go as we go on the project.</p>
<h4 id="how">How will I play this game? </h4>
<p>You will be able to play this on any browser and any device as long as you have javascript enabled. However, if you're on a school device like a ChromeBook or their Wifi. It might be blocked by default.</p>
